<h3>Objective</h3>
To create a recommendation system primarily using collaborative filtering.

<h3>Data Source</h3>
We used two datasets â€“ 98 rows of ratings (1 to 5, hate to love) in employee dataset and 280 rows in IMDb dataset on 50 movies. Both historical data from IMDb and internal employee data was used. The employee dataset was collected from peers using a google form.

<h3>Project Description</h3>
For starters we developed a basic model to predict movie rating for team members with both user and item-based collaborative filters. We then enhanced the model and predicted ratings for newly joined customers whom we have no prior data. On obtaining initial data on new customers, we fed this data to our system to see if it affected our predictions.
